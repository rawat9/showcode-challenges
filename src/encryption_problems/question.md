The power went out overnight, and disrupted the servers whilst they were updating. After restarting the servers, one of the engineers noticed that there are encrypted files that weren't there before.
Your job is to decrypt those files in accordance with the encryption policy set by the company.
If the encrypted letter is surrounded by (), then the actual letter is the letter that occurs 7 places before in the English alphabet.
If the encrypted letter is surrounded by <>, then the actual letter is the one that occurs 2 places after in the English alphabet.
If there are any braces {}, then all the letters that appear between them are in reverse order.
